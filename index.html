    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am from the Philippines. A former Able-Bodied Seaman with 6 years of
      experience in the seafaring industry. I was an employee of a Japanese
      company named Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Marine Inc., where we deliver
      LNG(Liquified Natural Gas) to different parts of Asia. English is the main
      language onboard ships where different ethnicities come to work. It is
      very important in interacting with different people in everyday task which
      teamwork is key. On ship, problems might occur without warning, that’s why
      we’re doing weekly fire drills, piracy drills and other necessary
      preparations, and safety is top priority. In cases of machinery trouble,
      problem solving skills is very relevant to keep the ship’s machinery
      running.
